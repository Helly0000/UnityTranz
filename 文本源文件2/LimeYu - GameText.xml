			<Text>Yu was a great sage, and he wearied his physical form on behalf of all under heaven like this.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Yu, known as Yu the Great, Great Yu, and occasionally Yu the Engineer, was a prehistoric Chinese monarch who was later deified and achieved legendary and mythical status. He is reputed to have founded the first Chinese Imperial Dynasty, the Xia Dynasty (though the existence of this era is disputed by some historians) and to have tamed the yellow river in order to allow his people to farm more reliably.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>It is said that the chinese heartland constantly flooded under King Yao, and that these floods were hindering development and endangering the people. Yao tasked Yu’s father, Gun, with creating a flood control system, but he failed despite nine years of work. Yu continued his father’s work and carefully studied Gun’s efforts with the innovation of dikes, dams, and self-expanding soil.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>After collaborating with a master of agriculture, Yu created a system to control the floods through a series of irrigation canals. It is said that during the construction of this project, he ate and slept with the workers, and did not visit his own wife and son. He personally assisted construction for thirteen years, and by the end he had become paralyzed. However, his efforts were successful and Chinese culture flourished as a result.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4" Language="en_US">
			<Text>King Shun (who reigned after Yao) was so impressed by Yu’s engineering and devotion that he passed the throne to Yu. Though Yu initially declined, his efforts had made him so popular with the lords and chiefs that he agreed to become the new emperor. His flood control work made him very familiar with all the Han territories, and he divided his realm into nine provinces. It is written in the Bamboo Annals that Yu ruled for forty-five years and eventually died of illness.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Though the veracity of the legend of Yu is disputed, he was highly regarded by all who came after him. He is one of the few Chinese Emperors ever afforded the title “the Great”, and was regarded as an ideal ruler in confucianism. He also became a water deity in Taoism and some Chinese folk religions. He continues to be revered to this day as one of the best emperors China ever had.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_CAPSULE_BODY" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Yu thrives with builders, giving a way to create many of them and giving rewards for using them all up. This allows Yu and you to very quickly become an agriculturally, scientifically, infrastructurally, and culturally advanced civilization.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_CHINA_YU_CHAPTER_DETAILED_BODY" Language="en_US">
			<Text>China’s dynastic cycle provides a good way to get ahead in technology, and Yu’s ability complements this by giving a new way to create builders and a way to boost science and culture when using them. This early game production bonus also allows China’s first cities to become quite advanced, possibly even capable of snatching the first few wonders. Use this to your advantage to give yurself a strong early lead in the game.</Text>
