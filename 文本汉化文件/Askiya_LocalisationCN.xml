			<Text>虽说阿斯基亚为统治或宗教胜利做好了准备，但他仍能够十分灵活地通过宗辅去追求其他形式的胜利。阿斯基亚应尽快创建一个宗教，并利用他对通往那些信奉其所创宗教的城市的贸易路线的额外加成，使这些城市能维持发展——哪怕城市位处最恶劣的气候环境。他应当集中精力攻占敌方文明中拥有多个区域的城市，以利于从通往此城的贸易路线中获取最大收益；同时从此城往外派出贸易路线，来帮助弥攻占时城市人口的损失。在桑海文明科技进步的基础上，阿斯基亚亦将拥有一只先进的军队来延续他攻占的特质；但通过维持宗教而坐拥强大贸易路线加成的他，也将会是其他文明（无论追求何种胜利）的威胁。</Text>

			<Text>【译者注：正在翻译，这也太多了草……】[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Muhammad I Askiya, also called Askia Muhammad, Muhammad Ture, and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr Ture was a West African statesman and military leader who usurped the throne of the Songhai empire in 1493 and, in a series of conquests, greatly expanded the empire and strengthened it. He was overthrown by his son, Askia Musa, in 1528.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>Both Askiya's place and date of birth are unknown. For a long time, he was thought to be a Silla (a Tukulor clan of Senegal) or a Toure of Soninke origin, but it now seems that his name, as spelled in Arabic by 18th-century Timbuktu chroniclers, was Muhammad al-Turi, or Muhammad of the Toro (Fouta-Toro of Senegal). It is thus believed that he was probably of Tukulor origin, from a Senegalese family that had settled in Gao. The name of his clan was probably Kan, or Dyallo. Oral tradition, however, which is still very much alive, makes Mamar (Muhammad's popular name) out to be Sonni Ali's nephew, his sister Kasey's son by a jinni, a supernatural being.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>After the death of Sonni Ali, the ruler who had solidified the Songhai empire from 1464 to 1492, Askiya tried to wrest power from Sonni Ali's son Sonni Baru, who had been elected by acclamation on January 21, 1493. In the Battle of Anfao on April 12, Askiya's forces, though inferior in number, were victorious. Traditional religions tinged with the esoteric Songhai Islam of the Sonnis gave way to an Islamic state whose civil code was the Qur'an and whose official writing was Arabic. After conquering the enemy, Muhammad I assumed the title of Askiya in order to ridicule, it is said, the daughters of the fallen Sonnis who said he would not rule. The name Askiya became the name of the dynasty that he founded and the name of its leaders thereafter.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>While Sonni Ali had been a warrior, Askiya was above all a statesman. He set up an efficient administration of the regions conquered by his predecessor. He began by dividing Songhai into provinces and placed each under a governor. A standing army and a fleet of war canoes were organized under the command of a general and an admiral. Moreover, Askiya created the positions of director of finance, justice, interior, protocol, agriculture, waters and forests, and of 'tribes of the white race' (Moors and Tuaregs who at that time were vassals of the Songhai and furnished them with squadrons of dromedary-mounted troops). All these officials were for the most part chosen from among the nobles and were brothers, sons, or cousins of Askiya.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>This exemplary organization of an African state was completed by a religious organization. Although a faithful believer, Askiya was not very well informed in matters of religious orthodoxy and therefore took as an adviser the Moroccan reformer al-Maghili, persecutor of the Jews of Touat, to help him put his realm in order, in particular to recover the possessions belonging to the descendants of the defeated Sonnis and to subservient groups not converted to Islam. Establishing Islam as the official religion of the nobles was without doubt the only error of this statesman. From then on, it was no longer a popular religion but an imported one that later was to justify the conquest of the Songhai by Moroccan Muslims.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>And yet it was to receive the necessary counsel directly from 'God's House' that in 1496 Askiya undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca. This pilgrimage has remained famous as much for the pomp with which it was carried out as for the marvelous tales to which it gave rise. The chronicler Mahmud Kati, who accompanied Askiya, wrote in Ta'rikh al-fattash that the jinn of Mecca had had Askiya named caliph and had told him what his rights were over the former vassal groups of the Sonnis. By the time he returned in 1497 or 1498, he was a leader deeply converted to Islam. Next he would proceed to consolidate and enlarge Songhai.</Text>

			<Text>Militarily he met with uneven success. Although between 1498 and 1502 he was victorious over the Mossi of Yatenga and the inhabitants of the Air (Niger), a few years later he undertook an unsuccessful campaign against Borgu (the present boundary region of Niger and Nigeria). And similarly, although during 1507 and 1514 he reduced the insurgent Fulani factions in Senegal and the Bornu factions near Agadez, one of his lieutenants, the Karta of Kabi, revolted against him in turn and, despite his efforts during 1516 and 1517, remained independent. As an organizer of an effective administrative system he was more successful.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>During the course of his lengthy sojourns in the capital, Gao, he set up with rare talent the system of tithes and taxes, the regulation of agriculture and fishing, and the recruitment and training of his administrators and governors. Sadi, the Timbuktu chronicler, has said that the territory that Askiya conquered 'by fire and sword' extended west as far as the Atlantic Ocean, northwest to the salt mines of Teghaza (on the northern border of present-day Mali), southwest as far as Bendugu (Segu), southeast to Bussa, and northeast to Agadez. It is certain that the influence of Songhai during Askiya's time was considerable and extended even beyond these boundaries. All the surrounding states, whether allies or enemies, experienced its civilizing ferment.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>This influence was reinforced by an indirect, though nonetheless profound, Islamic propaganda. Muslim scholars went into areas they would not have been able to penetrate without the Gao ruler's support. And for several centuries to come, the small African states and the neighbouring leaders would take as their model the Islamic empire of Songhai and its prestigious leader, Askiya. Even today, according to oral tradition, Askiya appears as a jinni, who either took after his father or after those with whom, by a special gift, he was able to consult during his pilgrimage to Mecca.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ASKIYA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_10" Language="zh_Hans_CN">
			<Text>The end of his reign was, however, tragic. Little by little his dream of an Islamized Sudan, whose emir he would be, evaporated. Even during his lifetime, his children were quarreling over the spoils. After the death of his commander in chief, Kanfari Omar, one of his brothers, in 1519, Askiya was no longer safe even in Gao, and the Songhai people seemed to him 'as crooked as the course of the Niger River.' Embittered, half blind, the old man had no one left but his friend and adviser, his servant Ali Folen. The almost religious fear that he inspired gave way to contempt. Musa, his eldest son, plotted against him and in 1528 killed his new general in chief, Yaya, another of Askiya's brothers, who had remained faithful to him. Musa then dispossessed his father, taking the name Askia Musa. He kept this title for three years before being assassinated himself by one of his brothers. Now deposed, the old Askiya Muhammad was banished to an island in the river, a place 'infested with mosquitoes and toads.' There, from 1528 to 1537, he was a blind and despairing witness to the murderous quarrels of his children over the territory of Songhai.</Text>

			<Text>In 1537 his third successor, his son Askia Ismail, recalled his father to Gao. To reward him, Askiya bequeathed to him his green turban and his caliph's sabre. In 1538, during a period of temporary calm, this founder of a dynasty died. Buried in Gao, Askiya left behind a legacy whose greatest achievement was bringing stability through provincial administration and the spread of Islam.</Text>
