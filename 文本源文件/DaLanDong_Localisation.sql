		"About 100 km (62 miles) off the coast of Belize lies the Lighthouse Reef, a small atoll glowing in vibrant hues of turquoise, teal, peacock blue, and aquamarine. Within this small sea of light colors, however, lies a giant circle of deep blue. Roughly 300 meters (1,000 feet) across and 125 meters (400 feet) deep, the feature is known as the Great Blue Hole. This site was made famous by Jacques Cousteau, who declared it one of the top five scuba diving sites in the world. In 1971 he brought his ship, the Calypso, to the hole to chart its depths. Investigations by this expedition confirmed the hole's origin as typical karst limestone formations, formed before rises in sea level in at least four stages. Even though the Great Blue Hole is considered a bucket-list dive, one should be aware that it is not for divers of all skill levels – a prerequisite is logging more than 24 dives. It is also not a 'colourful dive', instead, divers witness a dark cave with impressive stalactites."																);
