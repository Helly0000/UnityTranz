		"Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries."),

		"Obsidian is a kind of glass formed during volcanic eruptions, and it shares all of the basic physical properties of ordinary glass. Obsidian was a highly integrated part of the daily and ritual life of Mesoamerica, and its widespread and varied use may be a significant contributor to the region's lack of metallurgy. The material was highly valued, and was used for everything from weaponry to jewelry."),

		"From the Yucatan to the Pacific Islands, sharks play a leading role in the origin myths of many coastal societies. As humans took to the sea for trade and exploration, deadly shark encounters became a part of seafaring lore. In reality, sharks are the ones who need a repellent: humans are much more likely to devour them than vice versa. In China, a meal of shark fin soup has long served as a status symbol. In Iceland, h√°karl is a national dish prepared using Greenland shark. Shark meat is popular in Australia, where it is known as flake. And in Eastern Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean, shark meat has been traded and has been a significant source of protein for centuries."),

Hunted to near extinction by Americans in the late 1800s, in recent decades the buffalo has made a comeback due to federal and state wildlife programs.");
