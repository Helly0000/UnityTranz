		"The stunning landscape of Ngorongoro Crater—the largest unbroken volcanic caldera in the world—combined with its spectacular concentration of wildlife is one of the greatest natural wonders of the planet. The crater and the surrounding area is home to a population of some 25,000 large animals, harbouring a range of endangered species, such as black rhinos, African wild dogs, African golden cats, and some 500 species of birds. It plays host to one of the largest animal migrations on earth: with over 1 million wildebeest, 72,000 zebras and 350,000 Thompson's and Grant's gazelles migrating to and from the crater annually. The crater is part of the larger Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which was established in 1959 as a multiple land use area, with wildlife coexisting with semi-nomadic Maasai pastoralists practicing traditional livestock grazing."																);
