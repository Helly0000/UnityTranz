If you are to establish Iran as a force to be reckoned with, you must use your Aswaran and allied forces to secure triumph after triumph. Bring great swathes of land under your banner, and in so doing bring emperors to heel. Only by embracing that crucible can you hope to increase the glory of Iranshahr!</Text>

				As the favoured son of Ardashir, founder of the Sassanid dynasty, Shapur I had his work cut out for him. Following in his father's footsteps meant ruling a nascent empire that had already engaged the Roman superpower to its west. Fortunately, Shapur I was up to the challenge.

				Shapur had taken part in his father's campaigns well before his accession, going back as far as overthrowing their Parthian yoke. Probably to avoid issues of succession, his father went out of his way to make Shapur's role as heir apparent clear through assemblies, coinage, and rock reliefs. This was further evinced by the co-regency shared between Ardashir and Shapur, during which the pair was at odds with Rome. Plainly, Shapur had proven himself to both the magnates and his father as the rightful heir.

				During their synarchy, he and his father had annexed land in Mesopotamia as far west as Carrhae, thus securing a buffer between Rome and the Sassanid heartland. Soon after his succession, Shapur would face his first trial as King of Kings. In seeking to reclaim what Ardashir and Shapur had taken, the Roman emperor Gordian III invaded Mesopotamia with a formidable force. In its early stages, the campaign was largely successful. Though he mounted a tenacious defense, Shapur was driven deeper and deeper into Iranian territory. Such were the defeats that by time he'd taken Nisibis, key to the Sassanid frontier, Gordian was confident he'd march on the capital at Ctesiphon. However, Shapur brooked no further incursions; he mounted a successful defense that completely routed Gordian's army, forcing the emperor to withdraw.

			<Text>The sources are at odds over how exactly Gordian III died in this abortive campaign, but the result was the same: Philip the Arab signed a treaty with Shapur that ceded swathes of territory in Mesopotamia and Armenia, as well as a hefty tribute of gold. Shapur's res gesta at Ka'be-ye Zardosht gives us a detailed account of his view—or at least his narrative—and accomplishments with respect to this war and those that followed.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_SHAPUR_I_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5" Language="en_US">
			<Text>It is worth noting that Parthian Armenia was still a problem. A branch of the Arsacid family that had hunkered down in the region mounted continued resistance to the newly-established Sassanid dynasty, which would have to be extinguished if their northern flank were to be secured. This would prove to be a point of contention between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid empires until the end of the dynasty, and cause for Shapur to declare war on Rome. Later, he would have the Armenian king Xosrov assassinated in favour of a ruler more sympathetic to Iran.</Text>

				As part of their treaty, Philip the Arab had relinquished control over Armenia to Shapur, which was a promise he never kept (it's also possible that tribute wasn't paid in full). Shapur wouldn't stand for it. He marched on Mesopotamia, seeking to extract the terms of his treaty by force. Though he had to abandon the campaign briefly to put down some unspecified trouble in Khorasan, Shapur would return to Mesopotamia to, in his words, "annihilate a Roman force of 60,000 at Barbalissus". He would proceed to despoil Syria and its neighbors, capturing over thirty forts and cities in the process. The campaign was, by and large, a triumph.

				Shapur wouldn't stop there. Less than a decade later, he would commence his third campaign by marching on Mesopotamia, Syria, and the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. This would end in disaster for his Roman adversaries: Emperor Valerian and some senators were captured, and the emperor would live out the rest of his life captive to Shapur. This resounding victory brought swathes of land into Sasanian territory, and marked another notch on Shapur's belt. He could now claim to have killed a Roman emperor, imprisoned another, and make a third tributary. No stranger to the value of royal propaganda or the allure of being immortalized in stone, Shapur commissioned rock reliefs and inscriptions for all to know of his feats.

				His inscription at Naqsh-e Rostam, Shapur I's Ka'ba-ye Zartosht or SKZ, would prove to be a crucial source for historians. As a trilingual inscription of his accomplishments, family (and the fires he established in their names), retinue, bureaucracy, and captured cities, it offers a detailed account of his reign, and a rare glimpse into a Sassanid world lost in many ways to time and patently biased third parties.

				Shapur's momentous rule would be noted for his successful military campaigns, the king for his tolerance. He would increase the glory of Iranshahr by continuing his father's legacy, bringing swathes of land under Sassanid control, and proving himself time and again when confronted in the theatre of war. In gaining dominance in Mesopotamia and Armenia, and in his subjugation of Roman emperors, Shapur I would establish the Sassanids as a power to be feared and respected.

From an area crimped with highlands and ridges, dense with forest, and made all the more tenable by fortresses, the Daylamites proved difficult to conquer. Formidable as they were, even upon submitting to the Sassanids, the Daylamites retained their independence.

				They were employed and prized as auxiliary forces in the Sassanid Empire. Daylamites were accustomed to warfare in mountainous or otherwise rough terrain, and that hardiness extended to close-quarter combat as a whole. All accounts paint them in the same strokes: worthy adversaries who were some of the finest infantry in the known world. This is, perhaps, best demonstrated in the reports of Khosrow II's personal guard consisting of 4,000 Daylamites.
