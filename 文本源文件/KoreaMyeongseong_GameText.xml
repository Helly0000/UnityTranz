			<Text>Empress Myeongseong of Korea, more commonly known as Queen Min, was the last empress of Korea. She is recognized by the Korean people as a heroine, equivalent to France's Joan of Arc.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Empress Myeongseong was the wife of Emperor Gojong of the Joseon Dynasty of the Daehan Empire. During her life as empress, she strived diplomatically and politically to keep Korea independent of foreign influence. She is credited for introducing new Western technologies, such as trains, telephones, streetcars, and electrical lights. She also proved herself brilliant when handling foreign affairs, as shown when she summoned the help of Russia and the Qing Dynasty of China to block the Japanese from taking over Korea, which was within considerable influence of Tokyo's imperialistic ambitions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Japanese, Emperor Meiji in particular, viewed her as an obstacle. However, efforts to neutralize her or to remove her from Korea's government continuously failed due to Emperor Gojong's devotion.</Text>

			<Text>The Japanese resorted to sending ambassadors to Korea's royal court, but such efforts were eventually repelled, again by Empress Myeongseong. As a result, the Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Goro, faced with losing Korea, allegedly hired assassins to invade Gyeongbok Palace, the Korean imperial residence, and kill the empress in 1895. Two of the Japanese assassins were allegedly Shigeaki Kunitomo and Kakitsu Ieiri. Increasingly, other figures that were involved in this event are coming to light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The mercenary killers raped and slaughtered three women suspected of being Queen Min, and when they verified which was the Queen they raped her and they desecrated her body, displayed it in a small circle, cut it to pieces, and then burned the corpse. Other witness accounts indicate she was raped then burned alive. Other accounts claim that she was stabbed and stomped on, or that she was not raped, but instead had her genitals molested posthumously.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These criminal acts were witnessed by Russian architects and one of the guards named Sabatin and other foreign officials, who protested heavily. To appease these protests, and other growing criticism worldwide, the Japanese government eventually brought Miura Goro and the other assassins to a criminal court. However, all were cleared of murder charges on the grounds of a lack of clear-cut evidence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Emperor Gojong, enraged over the event, posthumously awarded his late wife the title "Myeongseong" and enshrined her in Jongmyo, Korea's state shrine. She is the only empress enshrined in Jongmyo; all other females are queens.</Text>

			<Text>Korea's unique science district, the Seowon, is going to be your most powerful asset, so completing the Writing technology early is essential in getting ahead of the competition. Plan its location carefully to take advantage of its benefits. Isolate the Seowon away from other districts to maximize the [ICON_Science] Science boost and gain additional [ICON_Food] Food and [ICON_Science] Science yields by placing Farms and Mines adjacent to this district. Combining these two benefits strategically will greatly improve your city output. Don't ignore Culture advancement, as gaining Governors to place in your cities provides an additional yield boost to your empire. You are very likely to want to appoint a Governors for each of your primary cities.</Text>

The Battle of Namhansanseong Fortress is regarded as the biggest battle fought by the righteous army, as more than 500 members of the righteous army and 300 soldiers were killed. The number of righteous army members rose rapidly in Seongnam following the collapse of the economy, and their tactics and strategies were refined as demobilized soldiers joined the righteous army.</Text>
