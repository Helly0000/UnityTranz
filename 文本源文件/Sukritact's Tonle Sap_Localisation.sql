		"Tonlé Sap, commonly translated to “Great Lake”, refers to a seasonally inundated freshwater lake, the Tonlé Sap Lake and an attached river, the 120 km long Tonlé Sap River, that connects the lake to the Mekong River. They form the central part of a complex hydrological system, situated in the 12,876 km² Cambodian floodplain covered with a mosaic of natural and agricultural habitats that the Mekong replenishes with water and sediments annually. As one of the world’s most varied and productive ecosystems the region has always been of central importance for Cambodia's food provision. It proved capable of largely maintaining the Angkorean civilization, the largest pre-industrial settlement complex in world history. As the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and containing an exceptionally large variety of interconnected eco-regions with a high degree of biodiversity, it was designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1997."																);
